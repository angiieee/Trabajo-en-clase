<h2>The Hole</h2>
<br><br>
<p>The hole is, quite literally, a void or an emptiness. It is Yonic. In the EARTH, it is a symbol of female fertility; in the roof of a TEMPLE or dwelling, it is the upward opening into the heavenly realm. Can be violence when meaning an inflicted wound, and can be phallic - vulva. Has two major aspects, it is related to fertility on the biological level and with the opening into another world on the spiritual level. Can also symbolize the passage from spatial to non-spatial.</p>

<h2>The Animal Spirit</h2>
<br><br>
<p>A long time ago, humans were created to be caretakers of the garden - Mther Earth. They held all things of creation sacred.  The people respected Nature and understood they were only a small part of the whole circle of life. Humans knew each part of creation played a significant role in the contentment and survival of the other. They accepted the divine idea that all things were equal and no animal, including man, held dominion over other parts of creation.  </p>

<h2>The Source</h2>
<br><br>
<p>The universe is a web of energy conveying life force through its emanations. All entities within this network receive and transmit energy through radiations. A unitive experience of spiritual, psychic, and physical energy occurs as a direct response to the impelling force we create within ourselves. Whatever integration we achieve results in the issuing forth of energy from a higher dimension in direct proportion to our self-invigoration. </p>

<h2>The Truth</h2>
<br><br>
<p>From a spiritual perspective, truth is the ability to know who you are. (In Oneness, there is no such thing as who you are not.)  Truth is allowing the essence of who you are to open your heart to you. Truth is expansiveness, it is opening, it is energy. And yet, it is nothing; it is no thing. And, of course, truth is in everything.</p>
